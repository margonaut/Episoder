Episoder

This personal project combines several concepts introduced in the first week of Launch Academy.

1. Setting up Sinatra sites, routes, and view files
2. Parsing HTML from third-party sites using Nokogiri
3. Object oriented programming and helper methods
4. Styling with CSS (some previous experience)

To run, clone in desktop and run 'ruby server.rb' from terminal. Visit http://localhost:4567/ or appropriate port in your browser.

Requires Sinatra and Nokogiri.

Known bugs to fix:
- Shows with special characters or apostrophes in the title return 404s
- Some episode descriptions return a set error message
